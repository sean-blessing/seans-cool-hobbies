Here are some of the things I like to do in my free time:
1)  My Family / Kids - Most of my free time is spent with my family and 
    the kids' activities.  My daughter is in a competitive dance team and
    this time of year she has dance competitions on some weekends, usually 
    out of town.  My son's favorite activity is cub scouts.  We do things 
    with his pack or troop at least 2 or 3 times a month.  My wife and I are
    looking forward to a trip this July sans kids in Park City, Utah!
2)  Music - I always have music on, in the car, at home in the background.  
    My favorite genre is rock / alternative / indie-rock.  But I also like
    many other forms.  I'm an aspiring guitarist, but have a long way to go!
    My favorite all time aritsts are Bob Marley and The Police.  My favorite
    current artists are Foals and We Were Promised Jetpacks.
3)  Running - I enjoy running, when not injured (like I am now).  :(
    I've run 4 marathons (Chicago, San Diego, Columbus, Cincinnati) but those
    were a long time ago.  I'm trying to get over an ankle issue and do a
    half marathon sometime soon.
4)  Hiking - As a family we love to hike.  We go to the Smokie Mountains 
    on spring and fall breaks.  Our goal is to visit all the National Parks.
5)  Movies - Love a good movie...  Action / Adventure, Comedies are my favorites.
    I am excited for the upcoming Marvel Avengers End Game, Spiderman and Star
    Wars movies this year.
6)  Craft Beer - I enjoy the craft beer scene in Cincinnati.  I live near
    50 West but my favorite local stop is Little Miami Brewing in Milford.
    My favorite Cinci brews are Braxton and Mad Tree, but my overall 
    favorites are from Colorado:  Oskar Blues, Avery and Breckenridge 
    Brewing Company.
